
1- A few months ago I decided to change my career completely. 
I started studying maths and programming to become be involved in 
the technology revolution involving Data and AI. 
That's my experience with the process 

2- The first months were chaotic. Too much new info to digest as well as many options. 
There were certifications, courses, master's degrees, PhDs...  I found it simple to get lost.
