# This is my portfolio!

Here I'm showing all the skills gained and project created in my coding journey. I hope you find it interesting. Topics in this portfolio are a wide range. I have some files covering the basics of programming like data structures and programming logic (mainly in python, MatLab and R), a couple of data projects where I clean the data and prepare it to feed prediction algorithms and neural networks and much more.
