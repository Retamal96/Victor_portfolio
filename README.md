# This is my portfolio!

Here I'm showing all the skills gained and projects I created in my coding journey. I hope you find it interesting. Topics in this portfolio are a wide range. I have some files covering the basics of programming like data structures and programming logic (mainly in python, MatLab and R), a couple of data projects where I clean the data and prepare it to feed prediction algorithms and neural networks and much more.

Let me give you a brief description of every project:

#### Computational_methods_Final_test;
This is a Script I made to pass the final test of the Computational_methods subject. The key point here was to extract insights from Ozone data. I couldn't use libraries except Numpy to calculate percentiles.
#### Core_python_uses:
A couple of scripts working with socket and txt files. 
#### Covid_map: 
Jupyter notebook using folium library to plot a map showing covid cases along with the world
#### Credit_card_fraud_detection V1: 
First Data project in a Kaggle competition. The idea is to predict whether a transaction was fraudulent
#### Data_science_with_python_Final_assigment:
final assignment for 'Introduction to Data Science With python' Course. I extracted data from a Wikipedia page and studied it to research the correlation between the population of a city and the excellence of its sports teams. 
#### Data_structures_projects:
Solving problems using python as NQueens problem, sudoku or a maze. 
#### Football_analytics:
Analysis of matches and events in these matches. This is an analysis of the 'Real Madrid vs Barcelona' match. 
#### Guessing_game, Hangman_gameHangman_game, Pong_game: 
Classical games coded in python 
#### Housing_regression:
Kaggle project to predict the price per zone of houses. The project consists of EDA, Data cleaning (2 files), feature selection, and modelling regression models. 
#### Kidney_research (in_progress):
team research in semantic segmentation in histological sections of the kidney to find glomerulus. The main idea is to use UNet to do this segmentation.
#### Learning_Sklearn:
Exercises I did to learn the SKlearn library
#### Machine_Learning_Course_projects: 
Projects coded on Matlab. They were done for the Machine Learning certification of Stanford. The projects include:
-  Logistic regression and gradient descent project
-  Logistic regresion Multiclass clasification 
-  Neural Network project
-  SVM and PCA project
-  Spam email classification 
-  KNN project
-  Anomaly detector
-  Recommendation System
#### Wikipedia_data_crawler_NLP: 
Script to extract data from Wikipedia and get the frequency of words. 
#### Tweet_crawler
